# Development tools

It does not matter what you are going to develop, one of the most important tools you'll need, is a text editor!

Text editor does not equal Text processor!

## Text Editor

A text editor is an app that allows you to edit some text! (what's in a name!)

Some text editors: Notepad++ (Windows only), Atom, VS Code (My First choice), BBEdit, Sublime Text, ...

## Internet Browser

This will probably appear as obvious but... It's a very important tool in the Dev. process!

Some web-browsers: Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, ...

## FTP client

An FTP client is an application that allows you to connect to an FTP server. (FTP = File Transfer Protocol)

This is very useful to upload your files to your webserver/webhost!

## More later

More tools will be added on a later basis!
