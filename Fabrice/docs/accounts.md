# Necessary accounts

In order to be able to use some of the tools we are going to use, you’ll first need to register an account!

Where do you need an account?

GitHub.com

CodeTasty.com ==> you can use your GitHub credentials to log in… With an account for those 2 systems, we are set to start coding our very first website!

# VS Code

Now that you are a Mac user we'll probably use VS Code as our favorite text editor!
