(Integrated Dev. Environment) An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

(Not all of these examples are free to use!) What's a 'WebIDE/Online IDE'? It's a browser based IDE that allows for software development or web development. A web IDE can be accessed from a web browser, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, allowing for a portable work environment. A web IDE does not usually contain all of the same features as a traditional, or desktop, IDE, although all of the basic IDE features, such as syntax highlighting, are typically present. The online IDE we\u2019ll use to create this website will be: CodeTasty.com/IDE It\u2019s a free to use (max. 2 projects) Online IDE, and it\u2019s quite power-full! Before we can start to code our first lines of code, we need to create some user accounts on a few sites so that we are able to use those tools! Enough bla bla for now, supposing the accounts are created, it\u2019s time to start our IDE and write our very first page! To do so, go to https://CodeTasty.com/IDE There\u2019s some configuration (very easy to set) necessary to start using a workspace but Dakta is going to do that this time. Our first website is going to be a simple static HTML website, this to learn the basics of HTML! This first website will be very basic with no styling, just plain text!
