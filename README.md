My-Docs

This repo is used to store the code files and directories created to generate Documentation.
In the first place, Sphynx was used to create these Documentation files but this is not longer the case!
Now, MKdocs is used as a Documentation creation system.
MKdocs offers easier settings and ways to create these docs, like Markdown syntax for the source files.
The configuration is done using 'mkdocs.yml' file
